# ofxLSystemGrammar

This addon implements most of the grammars described in "The Algorithimic Beauty
of Plants", and it can be used to draw LSystem plants or fractals. If you want
to see which kind of meshes it is possible to draw using this addon, got to
check the addon [ofxLSystem](/edap/ofxLSystem), that implements a 3D turtle
graphich interpretation of the strings generated with ofxLSystemGrammar.

Currently it supports:

- DOL system (DOL-system.png)
- Bracketed Edge rewriting
- Bracketed Node rewriting
- Parametric Grammar
